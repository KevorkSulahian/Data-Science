Group Homework #4

- You have to submit the group homework in both .Rmd and .pdf formats.
- Report (.pdf) must be minimum 10 pages long.
- Use command echo=F not to include any R code in your report.
---------------------------

In this group homework you will need to use Web scraping techqniques (Web Scraping and APIs) to scrap data from the Web and work on it.

Group Homework is divided into 2 parts.

1) Use Web Scraping or API approaches to scrap reasonable quantitative data from the web and do quantitative analysis (Plots, Vizualizations, Data cleaning, Meaningful conclusions, etc.).

2) Use Web scraping or API approaches to scrap reasonable text data and do text mining on it (Regular expressions, text mining, sentiment analysis etc.).

NOTE!!!---You can't use the same approach for two parts. Both Web scraping and API approaches must be used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Some examples of websites and APIs to scrap data:
